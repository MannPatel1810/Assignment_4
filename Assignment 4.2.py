# Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File

# Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
# 1.   Takes user input and writes it to a file named output.txt.
# 2.   Appends additional data to the same file.
# 3.   Reads and displays the final content of the file.

# Step 1: Take user input and write it to output.txt
user_input = input("Enter text to write into the file: ")

with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write(user_input + "\n")

# Step 2: Append additional data to the same file
additional_input = input("Enter text to append to the file: ")

with open("output.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write(additional_input + "\n")

# Step 3: Read and display the final content of the file
print("\nFinal content of output.txt:")

with open("output.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
